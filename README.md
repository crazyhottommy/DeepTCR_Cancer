# Deep learning reveals predictive sequence concepts within immune repertoires to immunotherapy

TCR-Seq (T-cell receptor sequencing) has been used extensively to characterize the immune response to cancer. However, most analyses of this data have been restricted to assessing quantitative measures such as clonality that do not leverage the information withDeepTCR_Cancerin the CDR3 sequence. We use DeepTCR, a previously described set of deep learning algorithms, to reveal sequence concepts that are predictive of the immune response to cancer in both murine and human data.
